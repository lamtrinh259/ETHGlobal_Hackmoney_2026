About
Yellow Network lets you deposit crypto once and make lightning-fast transactions without waiting for blockchain confirmations or paying gas each time. It combines the best of both worlds — the speed of off-chain systems and the security of smart contracts.
Most interactions between parties don't need immediate on-chain settlement. Consider a chess game with a 10 USDC wager:
- On-chain approach: Every move requires a transaction → 40+ transactions → $100s in fees
- State channel approach: Lock funds once, play off-chain, settle once → 2 transactions → minimal fees
State channels let you execute unlimited off-chain operations between on-chain checkpoints.
💡 How it works:
When you send funds or interact with an app, your transfers happen off-chain through a secure network of Yellow nodes that keep balances in sync. It feels instant, like using a regular web2 app. Smart contracts on each blockchain act as safes: they hold your deposit, verify everything, and make sure your money is protected. If you ever stop using the app or want to withdraw, your final balance is settled on-chain. Your session is protected by unique digital keys that only you control. No one can change your balance or take your funds. Even if something goes wrong, your assets automatically return to you.
🚀 Key features:
- Works as a Layer-2 network, not a new blockchain
- Enables real-time, gasless payments that still settle safely on your preferred chain
- Designed for games, apps, and tools that need instant user actions and smooth UX
- Includes built-in liquidity pools to make sure there’s always capital available for fast transactions
- Compatible with all EVM chains, Solana and others coming soon.

Use the Yellow SDK and Nitrolite protocol to build a mini-app or feature that showcases instant, session-based transactions - all happening off-chain and settling on-chain when needed.
💥 How to participate
- Integrate the Yellow SDK, connect to the Nitrolite test environment and create a wallet session.
- Implement off-chain logic: simulate sending or spending assets instantly between users or in-app actions.
- Show on-chain settlement: finalize balances through smart-contract calls when users end their session.
🛍️ Example App Ideas
- Trading apps
- Prediction market apps
- Tipping System: users send 0.01 USDC per like, emoji, or message without gas or delay.
- Pay-Per-Use App: charge users per API call, minute, or read action - settle once at the end of session.
- Cross-App Wallet: one balance shared across multiple dApps (browser plugin, Telegram mini-app, etc.).
💎 Why Build on Yellow
- Gas-free & instant: off-chain state channels = Web2 speed, Web3 security.
- Session-based logic: define allowances for in-game or in-app use.
- Multi-chain ready: works with all EVM chains; Solana support coming soon.
Qualification Requirements
✅ Qualification Requirements - to qualify for the Yellow Network Prize, your project must:
- Use the Yellow SDK / Nitrolite protocol in your submission.
- Demonstrate off-chain transaction logic — e.g., instant payments, session-based spending, or settlement finalized via smart contracts.
- Deploy or simulate a working prototype showing how Yellow improves transaction speed, UX, or efficiency.
- Include a 2–3 minute demo video showing your integration and user flow.
- Submit your project under the “Yellow Network” prize track on ETHGlobal and include a repo link.
🏆 Judging Criteria
Projects will be evaluated based on:
- Problem & Solution: clarity of the problem addressed and creativity of the solution.
- Yellow SDK Integration: depth and impact of integration with Yellow technology.
- Business Model: clarity and sustainability of the project’s value or revenue model.
- Presentation: ability to communicate the idea clearly and persuasively.
- Team Potential: team’s skill, passion, and commitment to continue post-hackathon.

About
LI.FI is a cross-chain liquidity and execution layer that lets you swap, bridge, and call contracts across many chains through one SDK/API. With a single integration, you can build DeFi experiences where users move from token A on chain X to token B or a position on chain Y in one seamless flow. LI.FI automatically routes across the best DEXs and bridges under the hood. During HackMoney you can use LI.FI to build cross-chain vaults, ‘deposit from anywhere’ on-ramps into DeFi protocols, rebalancing/arb agents, and wallet or fintech UX that treat liquidity as one unified market instead of fragmented chains.
Prizes
🥇 Best Use of LI.FI Composer in DeFi ⸺ $2,500
Awarded to the project that most creatively uses LI.FI Composer to orchestrate multi-step DeFi workflows in a single, user-friendly experience.
Examples Ideas:
Cross-chain deposit into a vault, staged leverage/hedging strategies, or multi-step LP provisioning with a single sign.
Deposit from any chain into a single restaking or yield strategy.
Turn any asset on any EVM chain into a Perps margin position on a specific chain.
Qualification Requirements
Use the LI.FI SDK or APIs for at least one cross-chain action (swap, bridge, or swap+bridge+contract call).
Support at least two EVM chains in the user journey.
Ship a working frontend (web, mobile, or wallet plugin) that a judge can click through.
Each submission must include a Github repository of the project and a video demo going through your project in detail.

Decentralized naming for wallets, contracts, agents, websites and more. Replace 0x addresses with human-readable names. Leverage portable profiles, payment settings, and social features with ENS!
Prizes
🎉 Integrate ENS ⸺ $3,500
Split evenly between all qualifying projects
Any type of ENS integration is eligible for this pool prize, split evenly among all eligible projects. Get creative!
Qualification Requirements
You need to write some code specifically for ENS, even if it's just a couple wagmi hooks. Simply using Rainbowkit does not count. Your demo must be functional and not contain hard-coded values. Upon submission, your project showcase must have a video recording or link to a live demo (ideally both) and the code needs to be open source and accessible on Github or a similar platform.

🥇 Most creative use of ENS for DeFi ⸺ $1,500
ENS is often thought of as simple name <> address mapping, but really its much more flexible! Names can store arbitrary data via text records, decentralized websites via content hash and more.
This prize goes to the most creative application of ENS in DeFi. This could be some sort of swap preferences stored in text records, DEX contracts that are named via ENS, decentralized interfaces or anything else.
Qualification Requirements
It should be obvious how ENS improves your product and is not just implemented as an afterthought. Your demo must be functional and not just include hard-coded values. Upon submission, your project showcase must have a video recording or link to a live demo (ideally both) and the code needs to be open source and accessible on Github or a similar platform.
